  What we do?
Faith House is a sober and safe house that builds leaders. We offer: Housing, meals, life skills, training, transitional support, counseling, and love. We are a safe haven for woman, children, teens, and men fleeing from a damaged past. A family oriented community for individuals who have been displaced. A welcoming set of arms and ears to all who need it. And a positive support for those exiting the world of corrections and addictions.


Our History
Faith House Ministries was founded in 2012, in conjunction with Abundant Grace Church.

Founders, Apostle Michael & Pastor Kathy Dance have been leading individuals to the Lord for over 25+years and are excited to welcome you into their family.

Mission Statement
Through our discipleship program, we walk alongside men, women, and families, offering a holistic approach that addresses
 their spiritual, emotional, and practical needs. We provide a safe space for individuals to explore their faith,
  deepen their relationship with God, and discover their true identity and purpose in Him.

Ultimately, our mission is to see families restored, individuals healed, and lives transformed by the power of God's love.
We strive to be a beacon of hope in a world filled with brokenness, offering a path towards reconciliation, forgiveness,
 and abundant life. Together, let us journey towards healing, restoration, and a renewed sense of purpose, as we embrace the hope found in Christ.
